# React.js: A dynamic UI library

React.js is a popular JavaScript library used for front-end development. React provides a toolset for developping dynamic and interactive UI. 

In my sample weather app, I use a few of React's key features - such as state management and (indirectly) the virtual DOM. As new input is handled, the weather values change. React handles the change and promptly displays them in the UI - this is what makes React so dynamic. The virtual DOM (Document Object Model) detects a change and is quick to reflect this on the web page.

## History

React is developped and maintained by Meta. It was realeased in 2013 to solve the issue of updating the FaceBook news feed in realtime without needing to refresh the page.[(ref)](https://blog.risingstack.com/the-history-of-react-js-on-a-timeline/)

## Why did I choose React?

I had heard of React but never used it before this term. When following tech videos or articles it seemed to pop-up alot whenever discussing front-end developpement. Honestly, I thought it was a completely different language than JS at first. However, a peer in the class mentioned they were using React, so I decided to learn more.

Learning React was beneficial for my knowledge of JS. I knew JS alone was a powerful front-end tool, but React gives better context for the "bigger picture" of front-end developpment. 

I'd recommend this package to anyone needs to code dynamic web pages. I'd continue using this in my own day-to-day, as it is a good skill to know if I need to develop front-end in the future. I might create my own website using React to act as a portfolio like many students do.
